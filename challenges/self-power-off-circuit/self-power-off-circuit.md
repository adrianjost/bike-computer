# Self Power-Off Circuit

## Goal

The goal of this sub-project is, to allow the microcontroller to fully turn off the circuit to reduce the idle power consumption as much as possible. This should allow the microcontroller to decide when all work is done and the OLED, microcontroller and whatever else is connected does not need any power.

## Specifications

- allow microcontroller to completely cut battery connection
- wakeup with a single button push - idealy no extra button should be added

## Resources

## Solution
