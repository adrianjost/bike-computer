# low battery warning

## Goal

I want to know when the battery should be recharged. I want to avoid starting a bike tour and the coputer goes of after a couple of minutes.
Ideally I could see some sort of battery level in steps, but a warning on a certain threshold (~30-50%) would be also better than nothing.
